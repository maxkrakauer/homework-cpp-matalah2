We have the node files (hpp and cpp) that define the individual node and it’s members including, left node, right node, parent node and the value stored in the node.
Then we have the tree files that defines a tree comprised of nodes. 
We have the TreeTest file that includes the tests that you gave us. We have tester2.cpp that includes tests that I added.
We use the command “make test && ./test” to run the tester2.cpp and we use “make demo && ./demo” to run TreeTest.cpp
